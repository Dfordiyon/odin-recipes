    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>A tres leches cake is a beloved Latin American dessert known for its indulgent moistness and rich flavor. It consists of a light, airy sponge cake that is soaked in a combination of three milks: evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and whole milk. This soaking process infuses the cake with a sweet, creamy, and slightly caramel-like flavor, resulting in a dessert that is both decadent and satisfying. Topped with whipped cream or fruit, this cake is a delightful treat that beautifully balances sweetness and richness, making it a favorite for special occasions and gatherings.</p>

    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
    <ul>

        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>11/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>11/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>12-ounce can of evaporated milk</li>
        <li>14-ounce can of sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, beat 4 large eggs and 1 cup of granulated sugar together until the mixture is light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Stir in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour and 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the egg and sugar mixture, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the cake batter into the prepared baking dish and spread it evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake the cake in the preheated oven for about 30-35 minutes, or until it is golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow the cake to cool slightly, then use a fork to poke holes all over the surface.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix together a 12-ounce can of evaporated milk, a 14-ounce can of sweetened condensed milk, and 1 cup of whole milk.</li>
        <li>Pour the three-milk mixture over the cake, ensuring it soaks in.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate the cake for at least 4 hours, or overnight for best results to allow it to absorb the milk mixture.</li>
        <li>When serving, you can top the cake with whipped cream if desired.</li>
        <li>Slice, serve, and enjoy your homemade tres leches cake!</li>
