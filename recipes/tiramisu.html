    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>Tiramisu is an iconic Italian dessert renowned for its luxurious and harmonious blend of flavors and textures. This elegant dessert features layers of delicate ladyfingers soaked in espresso and coffee liqueur, alternating with a luscious mixture of mascarpone cheese, egg yolks, and sugar. The mascarpone filling is creamy and subtly sweet, while the coffee-soaked ladyfingers provide a satisfying contrast. A dusting of cocoa powder on top adds a touch of bitterness that balances the sweetness, resulting in a delightful coffee-infused dessert that's both creamy and airy, making it a classic choice for indulgence.</p>
