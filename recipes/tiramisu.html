    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>To make a classic tiramisu, start by whisking together 4 egg yolks and 2/3 cup of granulated sugar until pale and creamy. Then, fold in 1 cup of mascarpone cheese until smooth. In a separate bowl, whip 1 cup of heavy cream until stiff peaks form, and gently fold it into the mascarpone mixture. In a shallow dish, combine 1 cup of brewed espresso and 2 tablespoons of coffee liqueur. Quickly dip ladyfingers into the espresso mixture and layer them in the bottom of a serving dish. Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, then repeat with another layer of dipped ladyfingers and the remaining mascarpone mixture. Dust the top with cocoa powder and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Serve chilled, and enjoy your delectable homemade tiramisu!</p>
