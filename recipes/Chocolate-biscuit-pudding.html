    <p><h4>Description</h4></p>
    <p>Chocolate biscuit pudding is a delightful no-bake dessert made by layering plain or digestive biscuits with a creamy, chocolatey mixture created from cocoa powder, sugar, butter, and milk or condensed milk. The biscuits soften as they absorb the chocolate sauce, resulting in a lusciously moist and indulgent treat. Variations may include whipped cream, nuts, or fruits for added texture and flavor, and the dessert is typically chilled in the refrigerator, making it a convenient and satisfying choice for chocolate enthusiasts and gatherings.</p>

    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Plain or digestive biscuits (around 200-250 grams)</li>
        <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder (3-4 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>Granulated sugar (1 cup)</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter (100-150 grams)</li>
        <li>Milk or condensed milk (1 cup)</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, melt the unsalted butter over low heat.</li>
        <li>Once the butter is melted, add the granulated sugar and cocoa powder to the saucepan. Stir well to combine and form a smooth chocolate sauce. Add a pinch of salt to enhance the flavor. If you're using condensed milk, you can add it at this stage as well, stirring until the mixture is well blended.</li>
        <li>Remove the saucepan from heat and let the chocolate sauce cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Take a deep rectangular or square dish (usually a 9x9-inch or similar size) and start by spreading a thin layer of the chocolate sauce on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Dip each biscuit into the chocolate sauce, coating both sides, and then arrange them in a single layer at the bottom of the dish. Continue this process, layering the chocolate-coated biscuits to cover the entire bottom of the dish.</li>
        <li>Pour some of the chocolate sauce over the biscuit layer, ensuring even coverage.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process by adding another layer of chocolate-coated biscuits on top of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Continue layering biscuits and chocolate sauce until you run out of ingredients, finishing with a layer of chocolate sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate the pudding for at least a few hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and the dessert to set.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, cut the chocolate biscuit pudding into squares or slices, and enjoy!</li>
